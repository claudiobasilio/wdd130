    <h2>My story</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I'm from Utah, North Ogden. I served my mission in Chicago, Illinois. I'm excited to be in this class with all of you. I'm majoring in software development! I have loved computers since I was a kid. I also love math and astronomy. In my freetime I enjoy ice skating, spending time with my friends, going out to eat, rock climbing, photography, and playing the cello. I love going to the temple! I'm taking this course so I can learn more about web designing. I have been a member of the church since I was 9 years old. I have too many good quotes hmmm I really like this one "Today I will make something that won't last for tomorrow or today it's for the future." Every single day is a blessing! Through small simple actions great things come to pass. Sometimes it can be hard to see our progress or we think we haven't progressed as much. Every single step made in the right direction is amazing to Heavenly Father. My hopes my dreams my future I will accomplish.   </p>
    <p>My favorite scripture would have to be Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not. Elder Carl B. Cook came to my homeward and shared this scripture with me. Be of good cheer always!</p>
