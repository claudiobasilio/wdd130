            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a little kid I have always enjoyed during cardistry! It was a way of expressing myself. Also I good way to meet new people and make friends! It all started when I was 9 years old at the time I wasn’t really sure what I liked. What kind of a person I wanted to be. What kind of friends I wanted to have. What makes me happy. What goals I needed to have. So many questions that needed to be answered. I remember the first time I saw of deck of cards I instantly got excited! The numbers, how each card looks, texture, and the artwork. During 7th grade I watched cardistry video after cardistry video. Watching each users way of flipping, shuffling, hand movements, and way of presenting the deck of cards. After watching each video I felt happy and motivated. I learned many things about myself around that time. What I like what I don’t like. Helped me make new friends! Cardistry helped me be the person I am now. I learned every kind of deck shuffle out there, different ways to cut the cards, popular ways of doing cardistry, and I also created my own cardistry video!</p>
            <p>Welcome to Cardistry Project where you can learn everything about Cardistry! My purpose is for you my friend to experience Cardistry. Lets get started! Check out this video I created when I was back in high school. It was for a talent show! Brings back great memories. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCHsbSCSo8s&t=1s</p>

            <h2>What is Cardistry?</h2>
            <h3>Cardistry - A New Art Form</h3>

            <p>Cardistry can best be defined as "the performance art of card flourishing". It is what happens when you take traditional playing cards to the next level - literally! It is about spinning them, tossing them, cutting them, and otherwise manipulating them - up, down, sideways, and around, and however else you can - in order to create an aesthetically pleasing display.</p>
            <p>The word "cardistry" is a combination of the words "card" and "artistry". So it is an activity that is about sheer skill and manual dexterity, in which a performer tries to create a beautiful display through the movement of individual playing cards or an entire deck. Cardistry takes an ordinary object that we are all familiar with - a deck of playing cards - and turns it into an art-form, by doing unfamiliar things with it.</p>
            <p>You could describe cardistry as the next step in the evolution of playing cards, because their original purpose for playing games or performing magic has been completely dispensed with. Instead, they are used for a brand new and interesting dexterity game of their own, without the strict rules and boundaries we are used to. And that is how it becomes a performance art, because this activity lends itself to creativity, and forces you to widen your usual perspective on a deck of cards, and do things with it that you previously have never even thought of, and things that you previously did not even think were possible!</p>
            <p>This is one of my favorite Cardistry videos of all time. Check it out! Brings back memories. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra_U_9g28Zw</p>
