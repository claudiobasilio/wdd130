            <p>Cardistry evolved from the flourishes magicians use, such as a fan and card spring. These flourishes have been explained in magic books for centuries and were offered as a way to embellish a routine. Ever since, magicians have incorporated demonstrations of skill, showcasing these flourishes in their acts.</p>
            <p>Around the turn of the millennium, publications from Brian Tudor (Show Off. Brian Tudor. Pascal Productions, 1997.) and Dan & Dave Buck (Pasteboard Animations. Dan & Dave Buck, 2001.) focused entirely on the art of card flourishing. Other publications quickly followed as the movement spread around the world thanks to advancements in internet streaming and the startup, YouTube.</p>
            <p>Although cardistry sprang out of magic. It is practiced around the world, mostly by teenagers, and continues to grow.</p>
            <p>Cardistry has become more than an art form, it is a lifestyle. There are cardistry brands and playing cards designed especially for cardistry. There are annual conferences and organized meet-ups happening regularly, as well as numerous competitions.</p>

            <h2>A Worldwide Community</h2>
